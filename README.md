# Solco AI ‚Äì Your Personalized Conversational Proxy ü§ñüí¨

**Created by Ajay Sharma (18 years old)**

## üåü Overview

**Solco AI** is an experimental personal assistant that doesn‚Äôt just *talk like you* ‚Äî it *talks for you*. This web-based AI system mimics your speaking style, remembers your conversations, and handles chats even when you're unavailable. Think of it as your **conversational proxy** ‚Äî one that stays in touch, keeps conversations alive, and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.

This is not just another chatbot. It's a step toward **intelligent digital delegation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Solco AI is powered by **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4/GPT-3.5** and integrates your **calendar**, **contacts**, and **chat history** to reply like you would ‚Äî in tone, context, and personality.

### üß† Features

- **Personality Mirroring**: Replies are shaped to match your unique voice using advanced prompt engineering.
- **Calendar Awareness**: Knows your schedule and responds accordingly (e.g., ‚ÄúAjay is in a meeting until 3 PM.‚Äù).
- **Contacts Integration**: Identifies who‚Äôs talking to you and responds with personal relevance.
- **Contextual Memory**: Remembers recent conversations to make interactions more fluid and human-like.
- **Secure by Design**: OAuth2-based integrations with encrypted token handling and scoped data access.

## üí° Motivation

This project began as a **vision**, not just an assignment.

I (Ajay Sharma, 18) wanted to build something that represents the future of *human‚ÄìAI collaboration*. After weeks of planning, prompt engineering, data integration, and technical iteration ‚Äî with the help of various AI tools and intense manual work ‚Äî **Solco AI** is now real.

This is not only a showcase of what I can build ‚Äî it‚Äôs a glimpse of where I want to go. It's a **startup-grade idea**, executed with a lot of care, time, and thought.
